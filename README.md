# Cloud based Resume Builder 

This project aims to build a cloud-based resume generator that enables users to register/login, enter personal and professional details, preview their resume in multiple formats, and download it as a PDF. The tool is designed with a strong focus on user experience, cloud service integration, and serverless automation using AWS. The system is fully scalable, secure, and cost-efficient, leveraging the power of AWS services like Lambda, S3,
and API Gateway.
